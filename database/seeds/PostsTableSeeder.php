<p>Based on a &ldquo;pay what you think is fair&rdquo; model, the &lsquo;Danang Free Walking Tour&rsquo; project focuses on providing customers with full, satisfying, and local experiences that visitors might otherwise miss during their trip to Da Nang &ndash; one of central Vietnam&rsquo;s main tourist hubs.</p>

<p>Breathtaking scenery, unique sights, and beautiful beaches are the main draw to Vietnam&rsquo;s third largest city, and the largest city in the central region.</p>

<p>The tours&rsquo; main goal is to help visitors experience the city from a local point of view, and hopefully walk away with a long-lasting positive impression.</p>

<p>The program&rsquo;s success is chiefly attributed to the enthusiasm and excitement of its tour guides &ndash; volunteer university students from institutions across Da Nang &ndash; and the diversity of the tourist sites customers are introduced to during the ninety-minute tour, including Han Market, Da Nang Cathedral, the Cham Sculpture Museum, and the Han River Bridge.</p>

<p>XP and Kathy from Hong Kong are just two out of hundreds of international tourists impressed by the tour.</p>

<p>The couple had nothing but praise for their energetic tour guide, Sofia, from the University of Foreign Languages in Da Nang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sofia is very passionate and knows a lot about the city. Her casual and friendly smile made the tour unforgettable,&rdquo; Kathy said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks to her, we learnt a lot about the history, culture, and lives of people here. This city is truly beautiful and has really impressed us. There are many things that we would probably never have learned had it not been for her enthusiasm and understanding. I will certainly recommend this tour to my friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Le Thi Thu Hang, an English major at the University of Foreign Languages in Da Nang, is another volunteer who began working with the project in August 2017.</p>

<p>Her preparation to become a tour guide included research into the city&rsquo;s history, culture, and traditions so as to provide tourists with useful and interesting information they might not find elsewhere.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks to this tour I have a chance to improve my language skills by speaking with foreigners, as well as learning about other countries&rsquo; cultures,&rdquo; Hang said about her experience working for the &lsquo;Danang Free Walking Tour.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have introduced many interesting things about Da Nang to foreign tourists and most have come to the conclusion that this is a city worth living in for its beautiful scenery, good infrastructure, variety of foods, and friendly people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Le Song Gia Han, another volunteer tour guide, has been with the project for nearly a year. The foreign trade student at the University of Economics in Da Nang has already guided nearly around 100 tours.</p>

<p>According to Han, volunteers stand to gain a lot from working with the program.</p>

<p>She says that apart from the chance to improve foreign language skills, their understanding of tourism also improves considerably.</p>

<p><strong>Difficult journey</strong></p>

<p>The &lsquo;Danang Free Walking Tour&rsquo; has become so popular that the organization now fields several requests from foreign tourists on a daily basis.</p>

<p>During summer, Da Nang&rsquo;s peak tourist season, the project operators often receive hundreds of requests. However, reaching that point was no walk in the park for its founder, Nguyen Minh Loi.</p>

<p>The 26-year-old shared that the hardest part of achieving success was building people&rsquo;s trust.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Our first try had a considerable number of volunteers participating but no customers joined the tours so the group quickly dissolved,&rdquo; Loi recalled of the project&rsquo;s starting phase.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There were times I would wander through intersections and touristic destinations to spread the word about the free service. However, most potential customers just avoided us.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We thought that it might be rude to approach customers directly, so we switched to advertising through posts, pictures, and videos on social media.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Eventually, many people began to learn about us and chose to participate. Thanks to their good reviews, many more people wanted to try our service.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Loi&rsquo;s project is not limited to free walking tours. The entrepreneur has also expanded the project to include the &lsquo;Foody Story Tour&rsquo; and &lsquo;Your Planner&rsquo; &ndash; a service designed to help tourists plan tailored trips to fit their interests.</p>

<p>While &lsquo;Danang Free Walking Tour&rsquo; and &lsquo;Your Planner&rsquo; are free, the &lsquo;Foody Story Tour&rsquo; requires a fee of US$30 per person.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;Foody Story Tour&rsquo; guides visitors through well-known restaurants and unique cuisine around the city.</p>

<p>The project also receives support from municipal authorities.</p>

<p>According to the vice-director of Department of Tourism in Da Nang, Tran Chi Cuong, his agency helps advertise the service.</p>

<p>Advertisements, leaflets and information about &lsquo;Danang Free Walking Tour&rsquo; are provided at the airport and several tourist destinations, he said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is a new form of tourism, letting tourists see the lives of people in the city,&rdquo; he added.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tourists get a chance to experience Da Nang&#39;s cuisine, culture, and history under a very new perspective</p>

<p>&ldquo;Moreover, by traveling on foot, the project is good for the environment and for sustainable development.&rdquo;</p>',

        		'body'=>'<p><strong>The &lsquo;Danang Free Walking Tour&rsquo; is a startup project developed by Nguyen Minh Loi from Hoa Vang District, a graduate from the city&rsquo;s University of Economics.</strong></p>

<p>In reality, foreign visitors always show their keen interest in exploring the distinctive cultural and historical values of the locality, especially a full immersion into the daily lives of local inhabitants. Taking advantage of this fact, Loi decided to pursue his strong ambition of developing a special travel project in which visitors from both home and abroad are introduced free-of-charge by volunteer tour guides to popular local entertainment, cuisine and shopping areas.</p>

<p>The tour is based on the Free Walking Tour model that has been thrived in many cities around the world. If participants are happy with tours, pay any amount they think is fair at the end of their tours.</p>

<p>The meaningful project comprises two 90-minute-long major journeys, namely &lsquo;Da Nang Around You&rsquo; running from 10.00am to 11.30am, and &lsquo;City of Love&rsquo; from 3.00pm and 4.30pm daily.</p>

<p>In detail, taking the &lsquo;Da Nang Around You&rsquo; tour, visitors will have an opportunity to learn more about the daily lives of local residents through their trips to such popular places as Han Market, the Da Nang Cathedral known to the locals as &lsquo;Nha Tho Con Ga&rsquo; (Rooster Cathedral), the Museum of Cham Sculpture, and the Han River Bridge.</p>

<p>The &lsquo;City of Love&rsquo; features such local love-themed locations on Tran Hung Dao as the Da Nang Marina complex, the beautiful Bridge of Love, and the &lsquo;Carp Turns into a Dragon&rsquo; statue.</p>

<p>It is common to realise that the project&rsquo;s success is mainly attributed to the great enthusiasm of up to 50 friendly volunteer tour guides in total who are university students across the city.</p>

<p>Embarking on their challenging but interning jobs, tour guides are encouraged to gain an insight into the city&rsquo;s history, culture and traditions in order to provide their clients with useful and fascinating information they might not find elsewhere.</p>

<p>Amongst hundreds of the participating visitors, Ms Alice from the UK was very impressed by her unforgettable tour to the Han Market and the Da Nang Cathedral during which the young woman immersed herself into the daily lives of locals.</p>

<p>Other participants also said that they would certainly recommend this tour to their relatives and friends once they return to their hometowns.</p>

<p>One of the participating tour guides, fourth-year student Nhat Vy, an English major at the University of Foreign Languages in Da Nang, eagerly revealed that: &ldquo;Thanks to this tour, I have a chance to improve my English skills and interpersonal interaction skills by talking with foreigners, as well as gain thorough grasps about her beloved hometown&rsquo;s culture and history&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Every month, a total of between 250 and 300 domestic and foreign visitors register to join in the free tour at the project&rsquo;s official website at http://danangfreewalkingtour.com.</p>

<p>Loi&rsquo;s project is not limited to the provision of free walking tours for visitors. The strong-willed man has added the &lsquo;Foody Story Tour&rsquo; and &lsquo;Your Trip Planner&rsquo; - a service designed to help tourists plan tailored trips to fit their interests.</p>

<p>According to the tour&rsquo;s website, &lsquo;Danang Free Walking Tour&rsquo; and &lsquo;Your Planner&rsquo; are free, whilst the &lsquo;Foody Story Tour&rsquo; requires a fee of 30 US$ per person.</p>

<p>Recently, the municipal Department of Tourism has enthusiastically helped to advertise &lsquo;Danang Free Walking Tour&rsquo; through widely distributing advertisement leaflets and brochures at accommodation establishments, the International Airport, and tourist sites in the city.</p>

<p>In the coming time, Loi&rsquo;s project will recruit new tour guides who can speak Korean, Chinese and Japan to serve potential visitors from these foreign language-speaking countries.</p>',

However, unlike Hue sweet soup, Danang people are keen on cold sweet soup.

Da Nang is a developing-city with modern facilities, traffic advantages, high motivation economic but Da Nang is highly well-known just a place where you should spend time as much as possible on. As for me, I love streets here. Streets lead us to many beautiful places making us just want to walk around without boring. Additionally, somewhere have their own stories, history or meaning to locals who live here. Another attract tourist by specialty of them. Streets make atmosphere to be comfortable, maybe mix a little ancient, maybe a bit noisy or maybe close, sweet. My advice to you when coming to Da Nang, prepare to detail a list of awesome sight-seeing by yourself to have a great experience in Danang.</span></span></span></p>',
